                            <p>OMA TestFests are designed to achieve a number of goals, including:</p>

                            <p>•  Ensuring the quality of OMA specifications</p>

                            <p>•  Enabling vendors to verify and test the interoperability of their product implementations in a multi-vendor environment</p>

                            <p>•  Provide a peer-to-peer networking environment for participants</p>
                            <p>
                                TestFests are held in a confidential and secure testing environment where companies can bring their Client or Server implementation(s) based on an OMA Enabler to test in multiple multi-vendor combinations.
                                These events are open to both OMA member and non-member companies.

                                There are 1 to 2 TestFest events held per year. These events are hosted in a variety of locations and venues throughout North America, Europe, and Asia.
                                Registration fees are per implementation (engineers are free to attend) and vary based on the expenses estimated to cover the event. If you are interested in hosting a

During registration, you will be asked to select which OMA Enabler you will be testing and if you are a Client or Server. The specified fee for that event will be due upon registering and the event information will inform you what the fee covers / includes for the event.<br /><br />
                                Once registration closes, OMA staff will create a formal testing agenda that will be distributed to participants on-site. More detailed travel and event information, including recommendations on where to stay, a general overview of the schedule, arriving at the TestFest, and what to expect on-site, will be distributed via email to all participants as registration is in progress and once registration closes.<br /><br />
                                Participating teams may download the test material to be used during the event under <a href="http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/index.html">each Enabler</a>.

                                At the end of the TestFest, OMA publicly posts the results of the event on OMA’s <a href="https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/wiki/2016-October-TestFest-Results">LwM2M for Developers Wiki</a> page via GitHub.

                                event listed. When you click on an event, a summary of the results are available for download (PDF). This report is an indication to the OMA Technical Plenary of both the completeness of the OMA Specification
                                as well as the quality of the implementations that are being tested.<br /><br />

                                One of the important aspects of any interoperability testing session is to record and process the problems found in the implementations being tested. In order for the relevant working groups to determine
                                how a problem should be resolved, TestFest participants may have the opportunity to raise their queries directly with the corresponding Technical Working Group.<br /><br />
                                For LWM2M Test events, participants are asked to submit any issues they encounter with the specification on the OMA GitHub <a href="https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues">Issue Reporting Tool</a> Issue Reporting Tool, which is monitored by the Device Management Working Group.
